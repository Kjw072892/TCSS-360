##   Salima Hafurova
### Estimate of Time: 
Around 1 week, I started working on this project after the assignment was introduced on Monday, June 30, 2025
### Shortcoming:
- No edge cases were tested by me.
- I didn't do any exception handling or use checkstyle to make sure my code was clean.
- Initially I had a very nested for-loops but Kassie helped me break my code up to 2 separate methods, one for main,
and the other for processing fields.

### Estimate of Time: 
### Shortcoming:
- I wrote readme.md instead of readme.txt.
- The Cyclomatic complexity of my code is high.
- No unit tests for input generator program or my individual solution.
- Implementation comments in my solution are not fully compliant with the course style guide.
- Incomplete JavaDoc.
